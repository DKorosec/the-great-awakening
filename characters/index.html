<p>Race: <em>Human</em><br>Class: <em>Paladin</em><br>Status: <span style="color:tomato"><em>Unknown</em></span></p>
<p>Lord Dominik was great paladin from the shipbuilder’s family. Even though he sometimes drank too much, he was always prepared to help those in need.</p>
<p>He was presumably killed in <a href="../locations#gladiatorland">Gladiatorland</a> by Githyanki warrior when he refused to hand out the sword that Githyanki demanded.</p>
<p>However he did not die that day or he was resurrected somehow as he was later (story-wise, earlier time-wise) spotted on Pladin, helping fight against Githyanki there by destroying their anti-magic shield. Hi was hit by an explosion after that and not seen since.</p>

<h3 id="plimorn">Plimorn Waveharp</h3>

<p>Race: <em>Human</em><br>Class: <em>Wizard-Bard</em><br>Status: <span style="color:green"><em>Alive</em></span></p>
<p>Wizard that, when not adventuring, spends most of his time in his lab, trying to science the shit out of magic.</p>
<p>During research he discovered that some branches of magic (such as healing) are simply not available to the wizards. So in his lust for more knowledge and magic power he has decided to also become part-time Bard to get access to more magic. Unlike most “real” bards, he could not care less about the music, he just uses it as a tool to execute spells that Wizard could not.</p>
<p>As any other researcher, he was writing down his findings and ramblings. Parts of his diary were later found and are being <a href="../plimorn-diary">published piece-by-piece</a>.</p>

<p>Eccentric half-olf dwarf that entertained the party time with his bagpipes.</p>
<p>He was killed in action near <a href="../locations#nukeland">Nukeland</a> when he accidentally hit everyone in the party using his thunderwave spell. After that Dragon attacked him and successfully killed him.</p>
