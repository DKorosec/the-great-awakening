<h1 id="Appendix"><a href="#Appendix" class="headerlink" title="Appendix"></a>Appendix</h1><h3 id="Not-quite-Markdown"><a href="#Not-quite-Markdown" class="headerlink" title="Not quite Markdown"></a>Not quite Markdown</h3><p>Although the Homebrewery uses Markdown, to get all the styling features from the PHB, we had to get a little creative. Some base HTML elements are not used as expected and I’ve had to include a few new keywords.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Horizontal Rules</strong> are generally used to <em>modify</em> existing elements into a different style. For example, a horizontal rule before a blockquote will give it the style of a Monster Stat Block instead of a note.</li>
<li><strong>HTML</strong> can be used to get <em>just</em> the right look for your homebrew. I’ve included some examples in the snippet icons above the editor.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Images"><a href="#Images" class="headerlink" title="Images"></a>Images</h3><p>Images must be hosted online somewhere, like imgur. You use the address to that image to reference it in your brew. Images can be included ‘inline’ with the text using Markdown-style images. However for background images more control is needed.</p>
<p>Background images should be included as HTML-style img tags. Using inline CSS you can precisely position your image where you’d like it to be. I have added both a inflow image snippet and a background image snippet to give you exmaples of how to do it.</p>
<h3 id="Crediting-Me"><a href="#Crediting-Me" class="headerlink" title="Crediting Me"></a>Crediting Me</h3><p>If you’d like to credit The Homebrewery in your brew, I’d be flattered! Just reference that you made it with The Homebrewery.</p>
